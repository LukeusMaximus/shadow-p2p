Normally we'd collect information about your projects using an online form,
but the CS web-site is being retired and SAFE isn't up to the task yet.  As 
an interim solution the idea is that

- you complete this XML file, replacing the template content but retaining
  the structure, and submit it via SAFE,
  then
- later, and hopefully (semi-)automatically, we'll import it into SAFE for 
  you in order to drive the assessment process.

If in doubt about the content of the longer sections, make sure you read the
unit handbook at

https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMSM0111/handbook.pdf

especially Section 2.1.2.  Remember that the specification is not assessed,
and there are no rules wrt. length of text for example: the point of the
exercise is simply to make sure you have a clear understanding of what you
will do, so you can start doing it.

In this section we want some text outlining the motivation (or context) for
your project.  Example content might include a description what the central 
problem is, and what previous work has been done to solve it.
-->

<motivation>
    Traditional Peer-to-Peer Netoworks involve a number of equipotent participants who form connections with one another to create a connected set of nodes. The issue with this is that every peer is given the 'identity' of other participants, usually in the form of an IP address which may pinpoint the individual that is taking part in the network. This presents a problem in the case where a user wishes to take part anonymously.
    The potential market for such a solution would be anyone who wished to act anonymously. A good example would be persons who wished to speak out against their government without fear of persecution by that government, especially in countries where such opinions are met with force and / or criminal charges (E.g. Syria, China). Other examples include file sharers who wish to evade copyright infringement charges / fines.
    Usually anonymity can be gained through the use of proxies or VPNs (e.g. Tor), however, the use of these systems in traditional P2P networks still shows some involvement in the network. Furthermore, these it is possible to trace the original user through monetary transaction records. True anonymity is very difficult for skilled users to achieve and is out of the reach of most internet users who might desire anonymity. Thus the solution may serve to prevent any effort to track down the users in the network and thus protect their identity (and in some cases, save their lives)

In this section we want some text outlining what you will to do within the
project; the best way to structure this is as a concise, focused set of 
bullet points outlining a) the high-level objective(s), and b) concrete, 
step-by-step aims that will move you towards this.
-->

<objectives>
    <!--
    * Investigate current methods of anonymity in use on the internet.
        * For each such method:
            * What level of anonymity can it provide?
            * What is the cost (financial or otherwise) of using it.
            * How hard is it to use?
    * Investigate existing P2P networks
        * Specifically bittorrent
        * Other networks with specific anonymity features
    * Create network
        * Theoretically
            * Under ideal conditions
        * Practically
            * Create network on a LAN
            * Attempt the same over the Internet or other WAN
    -->
    
    * Create a theoretical system for connecting peers with the greatest possible level of anonymity.
    * Implement this system over a LAN.
    * Attempt implementation over the internet (or other WAN)
    * Analyse effectiveness of solution (i.e. level of anonymity practically achieved).

In this section we want a plan for execution of your aims and objectives:
this can include time scales, but also aspects of resource and contingency
planning.
