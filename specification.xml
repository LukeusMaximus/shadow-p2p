<!--
Normally we'd collect information about your projects using an online form,
but the CS web-site is being retired and SAFE isn't up to the task yet.  As 
an interim solution the idea is that

- you complete this XML file, replacing the template content but retaining
  the structure, and submit it via SAFE,
  then
- later, and hopefully (semi-)automatically, we'll import it into SAFE for 
  you in order to drive the assessment process.

If in doubt about the content of the longer sections, make sure you read the
unit handbook at

https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMSM0111/handbook.pdf

especially Section 2.1.2.  Remember that the specification is not assessed,
and there are no rules wrt. length of text for example: the point of the
exercise is simply to make sure you have a clear understanding of what you
will do, so you can start doing it.

In this section we want some text outlining what you will to do within the
project; the best way to structure this is as a concise, focused set of 
bullet points outlining a) the high-level objective(s), and b) concrete, 
step-by-step aims that will move you towards this.
