Normally we'd collect information about your projects using an online form,
but the CS web-site is being retired and SAFE isn't up to the task yet.  As 
an interim solution the idea is that

- you complete this XML file, replacing the template content but retaining
  the structure, and submit it via SAFE,
  then
- later, and hopefully (semi-)automatically, we'll import it into SAFE for 
  you in order to drive the assessment process.

If in doubt about the content of the longer sections, make sure you read the
unit handbook at

https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMSM0111/handbook.pdf

especially Section 2.1.2.  Remember that the specification is not assessed,
and there are no rules wrt. length of text for example: the point of the
exercise is simply to make sure you have a clear understanding of what you
will do, so you can start doing it.

In this section we want some text outlining the motivation (or context) for
your project.  Example content might include a description what the central 
problem is, and what previous work has been done to solve it.

<motivation>
    Traditional Peer-to-Peer Netoworks involve a number of equipotent participants who form connections with one another to create a connected set of nodes. The issue with this is that every peer is given the 'identity' of other participants, usually in the form of an IP address which may pinpoint the individual that is taking part in the network. This presents a problem in the case where a user wishes to take part anonymously.
    The potential market for such a solution would be anyone who wishes to act anonymously and there's already a large market for anonymity. There are many reason's why a person may wish to remain anonymous on the internet; for the most part, it is the ability to speak freely without fear of reprecussion. Some use anonymity to speak in chatrooms about socially and politically sensitive topics, others use anonymity to leak information on their employers to journalists. Apostasy (the act of giving up or renouncing one's religious views) is illegal in at least 14 countries and it is punishable by death in 11 of those; therefore, anonymity would obviously be desirable when discussing the topic online.
    Usually anonymity can be gained through the use of proxies or VPNs (e.g. Tor), however, the use of these systems in traditional P2P networks still shows some involvement in the network. Furthermore, these it is possible to trace the original user through monetary transaction records. True anonymity is very difficult for skilled users to achieve and is out of the reach of most internet users who might desire anonymity. Thus the solution may serve to prevent any effort to track down the users in the network and thus protect their identity (and in some cases, save their lives)
    Software and Hardware solutions that grant some level of anonymity are already available. For example, the Tor Project (a software solution) and proxy servers (a hardware solution). However, these solutions are known to not perfectly protect anonymity (By the Tor Project's own admission "Tor can't solve all anonymity problems").
    I aim to create a Peer-to-Peer network where peers have no knowledge (or very litle) of the location of other peers. This will be created as a platform on top of which many P2P applications may be constructed. The bulk of the project will be creating the low-level P2P platform and then I will create some sample applicatons to make use of the platform effectively.

In this section we want some text outlining what you will to do within the
project; the best way to structure this is as a concise, focused set of 
bullet points outlining a) the high-level objective(s), and b) concrete, 
step-by-step aims that will move you towards this.
-->

<objectives>
    High level    
    * Create a theoretical system for connecting peers with the greatest possible level of anonymity.
    * Implement this system over a LAN.
    * Attempt implementation over the internet (or other WAN)
    * Analyse effectiveness of solution (i.e. level of anonymity practically achieved).
        
    Low level
    * Investigate current methods of anonymity in use on the internet.
        * For each such method:
            * What level of anonymity can it provide?
            * What is the cost (financial or otherwise) of using it.
            * How hard is it to use?
    * Investigate existing P2P networks
        * Specifically bittorrent, IRC
        * Other networks with specific anonymity features
    * Investigate the low level networking used by the internet
    * Design network theoretically
        * Under ideal conditions
    * Implement the design on a LAN
        * Implement in software
        * Note differences between theoretical an practical designs
        * Implement basic chat application using network
    * Implement design over Internet / WAN
        * Investigate required resources (e.g. VPS)
        * Further develop software for Internet / WAN
        * Implement file transfer / sharing application
    * Compare network to others
        * Comparison of anonymity provided
