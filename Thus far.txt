It turns out that scapy requires a change to it's socketry in order to talk to local applications due to the loopback link lay being entirely virtual i.e. packets are held in memory and passed to application that way.
This results in scapy requiring a different L3 socket to pass IP packets to the right place. Namely:

    conf.L3socket = L3RawSocket
    
and then IP packets get routed correctly. Isn't that nice?

and this one for in scripts

scapy.config.conf.L3socket = scapy.supersocket.L3RawSocket

It is a better idea to find some neutral mediator rather than attempting shotgun packet transmission.
This approach is more efficient bandwidth wise and probably saves time sending packets too.
Perhaps using the Google Drive API we can use google as a mediator to transmit data.
A mediator is usable if it doesn't reveal any info on the users' identity.

Decided neutral mediators makes things too easy and uninteresting.

Tor:
Provides anonymity by having clients connect to the wider internet through a relay chain of their peers.
There are different encryption keys for each hop so no node knows where the message came from.
The end point of the client's communication on the open internet will appear to have come from a different IP.
The client can change routes through Tor and usually does so every few minutes.
This prevents future activities being linked to past ones.
